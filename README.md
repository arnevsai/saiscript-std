# saiscript-std
The standalone, runnable version of SaiScript.

**Requirements**

In order to run the SaiScript interpreter and compiler, you will need to have Node.JS installed. You can get Node at http://nodejs.org.

**Important Notes**

The standalone version of SaiScript and the production version of SaiScript for Arnev Sai do not scale properly! For example, all Discord functionality is emulated and may not be the exact same!
